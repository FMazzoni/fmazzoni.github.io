## Hello

My name's Fernando,

I am a Geospatial Data Scientist at [Cyvl.ai](https://www.cyvl.ai/).

> *I like to help streamline and empower cities by leveraging data-driven decision-making techniques that incorporate remote sensing, machine learning, and geospatial analysis through my work at  [Cyvl.ai](https://www.cyvl.ai/).*

I also enjoy solving puzzle games, check out pythagorea if you havenâ€™t yet!
