# Introduction:

MathJax is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to render mathematical equations in a web browser. It uses the $\LaTeX$ syntax for writing equations, which is a standard for writing mathematical equations. MathJax can be used to display equations in a web page, or it can be used to render equations in a web browser. In this article, we will show you how to display equations in a web page.

# Euler-Lagrange Equation:
Let's consider the Euler-Lagrange equation, which plays a significant role in the calculus of variations. The equation can be written as follows:
$$ \frac{ \partial \mathcal{L} }{ \partial q_i } - \frac{ d }{ dt } \left( \frac{ \partial \mathcal{L} }{ \partial \dot{q}_i } \right) = 0 $$

Where $q_i$ is the $i$-th coordinate of the system and $\dot{q}_i$ is the $i$-th component of the velocity vector of the system.
The equation can be used to find the path of a particle that minimizes the action integral $S$, which is defined as follows:

$$S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \mathcal{L} dt$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian of the system. The Lagrangian is defined as follows:

$$\mathcal{L} = T - V$$

where $T$ is the kinetic energy of the system and $V$ is the potential energy of the system. The Euler-Lagrange equation can be used to find the path of a particle that minimizes the action integral $S$.


# Maxwell's Equations:

Maxwell's equations are a set of four partial differential equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. They are named after James Clerk Maxwell, who first derived them in 1861. The equations can be written as follows:

1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields:
$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$
where $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}$ represents the divergence of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$, $\rho$ is the charge density, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

1. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields:
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$
where $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}$ represents the divergence of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$.

1. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction:

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$

where $\nabla \times \mathbf{E}$ represents the curl of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$, $\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$ represents the partial derivative of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ with respect to time.

4. Amp√®re's Law with Maxwell's Addition:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left(\mathbf{J} + \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\right)
$$
where $\nabla \times \mathbf{B}$ represents the curl of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $\mathbf{J}$ represents the current density, $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$ represents the partial derivative of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ with respect to time.

These equations describe the fundamental behavior of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with charges and currents. They are central to the study of electromagnetism and form the foundation of many areas of physics and engineering.
